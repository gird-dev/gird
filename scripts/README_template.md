# Gird

Gird is a lightweight & general-purpose [Make][make]-like build tool & task
runner for Python.

[make]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)

Gird can be used to manage any project where some tasks need to be executed
automatically when some dependencies are updated. The goal of Gird is to combine
the following features.

- A simple, expressive, and intuitive rule definition and execution scheme very
  close to that of Make.
- Configuration in Python, allowing straightforward and familiar usage, without
  the need for a dedicated rule definition syntax.
- Ability to take advantage of Python's flexibility and possibility to easily
  integrate with Python libraries and tools.
- Emphasis on API simplicity & ease of use.

## Installation

Install Gird from PyPI with `pip install gird`, or from sources with
`pip install .`.

Gird requires Python version 3.9 or newer, and is supported on Linux & macOS.

## Usage

Define "rules" in *girdfile.py*. Depending on the composition of a rule
definition, a rule can, for example,

- define a recipe to run a task, e.g., to update a target file,
- define prerequisites for the target, such as dependency files or other rules,
  and
- use Python functions for more complex dependency & recipe functionality.

A rule is invoked by `gird {target}`, with optional parallel execution. To list
all rules, run `gird list`.

### Example girdfile.py

This is the girdfile.py of the project itself.

Respective output from `gird list`:
