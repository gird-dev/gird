# Gird

Gird is a Make-like build tool & task runner for Python.

Gird can be used to manage any project where some tasks need to be executed
automatically when some dependencies are updated. In Make, this usually means
updating files based on changes in other files. Compared to Make, Gird provides

- a simple Python interface,
- good Python integrability, and
- additional dependency management features.

### Comparison with other tools

- [Make][make] has many features that could be replaced by a comprehensive
  Python integration/API (Gird). Dedicated single-purpose rule definition
  syntax.
- [doit][doit]'s API is unclear/absent. The database can more or less be a black
  box.
- [Invoke][invoke] doesn't support file-based update chaining.
- [Snakemake][snakemake] & [CMake][cmake] are heavyweight & complicated with too 
  many responsibilities.

### Installation

Install Gird from PyPI with `pip install gird`, or from sources with
`pip install .`.

#### Requirements

Gird is built & tested for Python versions 3.8 & above.

Gird requires [Make][make] to be available on the system. Most versions of Make
will do, as long as they support the `.PHONY` & `.ONESHELL` special targets.

### Usage

Define "rules" in *girdfile.py*. Depending on the composition of a rule
definition, the rule can, for example,

- define a recipe to run a task, e.g., to update a target file,
- define prerequisites for the target, such as dependency files or other rules,
  and
- use Python functions for more complex target & recipe functionality.

A rule is invoked by `gird <target_name>`. To list all targets, run
`gird --list`.

### Implementation of Gird

Internally, Gird generates Makefiles & uses Make to run tasks, but interacting
with Make in any way isn't obligatory when using Gird. In the future, Make as a
dependency of Gird might be replaced altogether.
